# üñºÔ∏è Image Classification with ResNet50

This project demonstrates image classification using the ResNet50 model, which is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The goal of this project is to classify images from a directory using the ResNet50 deep learning model.

üöÄ Project Overview
Key Features:
Image Preprocessing: Images are resized to 224x224 pixels and preprocessed to match the input requirements of ResNet50.
Model: Utilizes the ResNet50 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, to classify images into thousands of possible categories.
Prediction: The model predicts the class of each image, and the top predicted class is displayed along with the corresponding image file name.

üîß How It Works:
Load Images: The images from the specified directory are loaded and displayed.
Preprocessing: Images are resized, converted to arrays, and prepared for model input.
Prediction: The pre-trained ResNet50 model predicts the class of each image.
Results: The top predicted class for each image is printed along with its file path.

üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements:
Batch Processing: Add batch processing to handle larger datasets more efficiently.
Model Optimization: Experiment with fine-tuning the model to improve classification accuracy on specific datasets.
Web Deployment: Deploy the model using a web interface for user-friendly access.
